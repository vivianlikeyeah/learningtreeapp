#The following code is written in python.
#The code says hello to a everyone in a list of people.
#Every time we say hello we increase the number of times we've said hello.
#The comments will explain each step.

#Create a counter for the number of times we have said hello
counter = 0

#The print statement is used  to display text.
#print("Hi") would display hi.

#To access the first element of this array you call friends[0]
#If I were to print friends[0] the outcome would be "Vivian"
#If I were to print friends[1] the outcome would be "Mike"
#And so on and so forth.
